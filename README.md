# Adventure
This repository contains the implementation of an artificial intelligence agent designed for The Adventure World, a grid-based puzzle game inspired by The Wumpus World.
Adventure World is a game inspired by Russell and Norvig's (2020) Wumpus World. The Adventure World is a n Ã— n grid of cells, which some cells may include a Pit, from which the player cannot climb out. 
Some cells contain a gold coin. The player's goal is to collect at least two gold coins, then return home and depart. Our goal is to create an agent that tells the player which cells are safe, unsafe, and unknown. 
This project demonstrates informed search algorithms, knowledge representation, and logic-based reasoning using Prolog.
